<p> My name is Imani Dillahunt. I was born and raised in Raleigh NC.
    <br> My passion has always been with children. At the age of 13, I got my first job as a Jr.Staff.
    <br> I worked here until I graduated highschool in 2012. From there I attended William Peace University.
    <br> Im 2013 I moved to Charlotte, to study Elementary Education and a minor in Spanish.
    <br> After graduating college I got my first job as a teacher. July 2020 I moved back to my hometown to be close to family.
    <br> I am now in my third year of teaching 1st grade. Looking to switch career paths into being a Web Developer.
